# Welcome to Hazel's Cat Bed!

I’m Hazel, currently studying Electrical Engineering at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University. I’m passionate about exploring how mathematics, hardware, and finance intersect — with a long-term goal of building a career that bridges EE and actuarial science.

Since high school, I’ve been driven by a love for math, astronomy, and the satisfaction that comes from solving complex problems. At university, I’ve challenged myself through a diverse range of courses — from logic design and digital systems to probability, object-oriented programming. Alongside my major, I plan to pursue a minor in Financial and to pass three SOA exams before graduation.I’m always excited to meet like-minded people and share experiences together. Hope that I build something meaningful!
